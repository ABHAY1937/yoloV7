# YOLOv7 Transfer Learning Project

This project is a YOLOv7 implementation with transfer learning for object detection. It includes the necessary libraries and steps to train your custom model using your own dataset. You can also use a pre-trained model for inference.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- YOLOv7 repository (link to your YOLOv7 repository or provide installation steps)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov7-transfer-learning.git
   cd yolov7-transfer-learning
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Preparation
Collect and Label Your Dataset
Collecting a well-labeled dataset is crucial for training a YOLOv7 model. Follow these steps:

Gather a diverse set of images or videos that represent the objects you want to detect.
Use annotation tools like LabelImg, VGG Image Annotator (VIA), or RectLabel to label objects in your images.
Label each object with a bounding box and assign a class label. YOLOv7 requires labels in the YOLO format (e.g., <class_id> <center_x> <center_y> <width> <height>).
Organize Your Dataset
Organizing your dataset properly makes it easier to work with. Your dataset directory structure should look like this:

markdown
Copy code
- data/
  - custom/
    - images/
      - train/
        - image1.jpg
        - image2.jpg
        ...
      - val/
        - image101.jpg
        - image102.jpg
        ...
    - labels/
      - train/
        - image1.txt
        - image2.txt
        ...
      - val/
        - image101.txt
        - image102.txt
        ...
  - custom.yaml
data/custom/images/train/ should contain your training images.
data/custom/images/val/ should contain your validation images.
data/custom/labels/train/ should contain the corresponding label files for training images.
data/custom/labels/val/ should contain the corresponding label files for validation images.
data/custom.yaml is a YAML file that specifies your dataset configuration. It should include paths to training and validation data, class names, and other dataset-specific information.
Update Configuration Files
YOLOv7 uses configuration files (.cfg) to define model architecture and training settings. Customize the configuration file (e.g., models/custom.cfg) to match your dataset and training requirements:

Adjust the nc parameter to specify the number of classes in your dataset.
Modify train, val, and other paths to point to your dataset directories.
Set batch size, learning rate, and other hyperparameters as needed.
Training
To train your custom YOLOv7 model, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data data/custom.yaml --cfg models/custom.cfg --weights weights/pretrained.pt --batch-size 8
Make sure to adjust the paths and parameters according to your dataset and training preferences. You can further customize the training process by modifying other training parameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate schedules, and more.

Inference
You can use your trained model for inference with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source data/samples --weights weights/best.pt
Replace weights/best.pt with the path to your trained model weights. After running the inference command, you'll get bounding box predictions for detected objects in the specified source.

Demo
For a real-time demonstration using your webcam, run:

bash
Copy code
python webcam.py --weights weights/best.pt
This will display object detection results from your webcam in real-time.

Sample Output
Insert sample images or videos here to showcase your project's results.
