Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
OpenCV
YOLOv7 repository (link to your YOLOv7 repository or provide installation steps)
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov7-transfer-learning.git
cd yolov7-transfer-learning
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Preparation
To train your custom YOLOv7 model, you need to prepare your dataset. Follow these steps:

Collect and label your dataset: Add your images and label them using annotation tools or formats compatible with YOLO.

Organize your dataset: Place your labeled images and annotation files in the appropriate directories, following the YOLOv7 dataset structure.

Update configuration files: Modify the YOLOv7 configuration files to match your dataset and model requirements.

Training
To train your custom YOLOv7 model, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data data/custom.yaml --cfg models/custom.cfg --weights weights/pretrained.pt --batch-size 8
Make sure to adjust the paths and parameters according to your dataset and training preferences.

Inference
You can use your trained model for inference with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source data/samples --weights weights/best.pt
Replace weights/best.pt with the path to your trained model weights.

Demo
For a real-time demonstration using your webcam, run:

bash
Copy code
python webcam.py --weights weights/best.pt
This will display object detection results from your webcam in real-time.
